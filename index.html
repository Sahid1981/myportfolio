                <P>Hi! I’m Juha Jermalainen, a second-year Information and Communications Technology engineering student at Oamk, specializing in software development. I am currently transitioning into the tech industry after 20 years of experience in customer service within the restaurant field, bringing with me strong communication skills, resilience under pressure, and a natural ability to work with people.
                I’m passionate about software development, modern technologies, and home automation. I enjoy solving problems, building efficient solutions, and seeing ideas come to life through code. Through my studies and personal projects, I’ve gained experience in programming, application development, and exploring how technology can improve everyday life.
                As a father, I value balance between family life, learning, and future career growth. My goal is to build a career in software development where I can combine customer-oriented thinking, technical skills, and a continuous desire to improve.
                Interests

                -Software development & modern technologies
                -Smart home & automation systems
                -System optimization & usability
                -Continuous learning and self‑development</P>
